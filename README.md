# Bootcamp Tasks examples ðŸŽ’
> In this repo youâ€™ll find some examples of tasks Iâ€™ve accomplished during my Software Engineering Bootcamp training.
> Youâ€™ll see my progress from simple and basic assignments to writing more complex and sophisticated code.

# Overview ðŸ“š
> This repo contains two main files corresponding with a project each: a file.py named 'task_7_Lists_Dicts_cafe', and a directory named 'task_24_sticky_notes_app' which contains all directories and files of a Django project.

## Task 7: Handling Dictionaries

### Task 7 General information
- Imagining Iâ€™m running a cafÃ©, the task consists of creating dictionaries to handle the data regarding stock and prices. 
- I had to calculate the total stock worth in my cafÃ© by looping through the dictionaries.
- A tip to achieve this was to set â€˜itemsâ€™ as keys to access the corresponding â€˜stockâ€™ and â€˜priceâ€™ values.

### Technologies Used
- Tech 1 - Python version 3.12.2



## Task 24: Sticky Notes App

### Task 24 General information
- Create a Django project, defining the model, running migrations, and implementing views and forms. 
- Focus on configuration of URL patterns, creating templates, styling with CSS, collecting static files, running migrations, and creating posts for the sticky notes application.
- Demonstrate understanding of the Model-View-Template (MVT) architecture and implement CRUD functionality.
- I have excluded the venv folder; you can generate it to use this application.
